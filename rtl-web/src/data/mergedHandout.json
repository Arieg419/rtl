Through a case of an outpatient presenting with incidental hypercalcemia and no symptoms, Dr. Hamnvik walks through ways to differentiate the various causes of hypercalcemia, from primary hyperparathyroidism to non-PTH-mediated sources such as malignancy. Together, they discuss the normal regulation of calcium in the body and explore the ways in which various labs can be used in conjunction to pinpoint the diagnosis, paying attention to possible laboratory artifacts. The conversation closes with ways to manage both inpatient and outpatient hypercalcemia, in addition to learning several clinical pearls from Dr. Hamnvik!http://runthelistpodcast.com/endocrinology/#hypercalcemia",
