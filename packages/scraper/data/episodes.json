The conversation closes with Dr. Blair’s three major clinical takeaways, but you’ll have to tune in to find out!","imgUrl":"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5d2501c14c57720001ff2b07/1592320099862-WVLUZR2NMUDXU8NY8C89/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kI-5DcnwWDwDOWLLRb31lU9Zw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZUJFbgE-7XRK3dMEBRBhUpwL0v5GzQtL5Q4U4g5RyqWA6c0CrpxYVvbWPEWNU2Xi9XCaSNtt2-ArBmEPQmKlwUA/Screen%2BShot%2B2020-06-16%2Bat%2B10.48.08%2BAM.jpg","imgAlt":"Screen+Shot+2020-06-16+at+10.48.08+AM.jpg","podcastUrl":"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d2501c14c57720001ff2b07/t/5ec73291234e0f518bd1e04f/1590112971487/RTL_Hyperthyroidism.mp3/original/RTL_Hyperthyroidism.mp3","podcastDurationMS":"1159000"},{"category":"endocrinology","title":"EPISODE 31: HYPOTHYROIDISM","summary":"Dr. Rachel Blair, an endocrinology fellow at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, joins Dr. Navin Kumar (host) and Sarah Onorato (case presenter) to discuss hypothyroidism.
